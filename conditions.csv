414,Conditions,I want to start off by saying I don’t think legal action is the appropriate response for my situation. I more am looking to guidance and resources. My apartment complex recently decided they were overwhelmed with the amount of packages they were receiving for tenants and have decided they are no longer going to be accepting them to be picked up by tenants. While I understand the issue lies in the fact that all packages are being returned to sender being marked as “package refusal”. From everything I have been reading only the addressee can refuse a package in order for it to be returned to sender. I have contacted USPS and was told by one employee to get a PO Box and promptly hung up on. I have filed another complaint but have yet to hear back. My husband has also filed a complaint and was told there was nothing that could be done. Upon reading recent reviews of my complex I found that I am not the only one experiencing this issue. One tenant was forced to get a PO Box in order to receive important work related items. According to the USPS website it does state that a new or remodeled apartment complex is required to have 1 parcel box per every 5 mail box compartments. I now legal action agains the USPS is not the option nor can I pursue legal action against the complex per the lease. I am not a person that is fond of the idea that nothing can be done about a situation and I’m just hoping I can get some idea on what to do next. I have seen some discourse on the neighborhood app and Reddit regarding this issue. The complex insists that USPS is to blame and USPS insists that the complex is to blame. Many tenants have gone to the front office and the local post office and nothing has changed. The complex will not install parcel boxes as they state it would be too big of a project and USPS says they will not hold packages despite this being their protocol. Upon speaking to the front office I was told to use a fiends address or work address in order to receive my packages. USPS insists I should pay for a PO Box. While I understand this is the easy fix. It is not the route I am going to consider going. I have contacted the Austin tenant council and they stated to seek legal advice.  I have also been informed that the complex was issued an official 30 day notice to install parcel boxes and that has obviously been ignored.  I have also contacted the property management company Northland Investment corporation and they have not replied. Other tenants have done the same with the same results.

There are also neighbor issues he refuses to confront such as vandalism and drug trafficking. I have called him over there being used syringes and property damage his answer to everything is he doesn't live here and if I don't like it I can move. The issue is he has monopolized the town I was born and raised in and he has single handedly infested every building he owns because he refuses to treat any of them.

Most recently, I have communicated with them over the past three weeks about being unable to inhabit the apartment as a result of the bug infestation that they have been unable/unwilling to properly investigate and identify, and I have accrued many costs, financial and social/emotional, as a result (hotel costs, missing work, dermatologist fees to assess the bites multiple times, gaslighting by pest control and property managers, inappropriate comments made to me by pest control, etc.).

7206,Conditions,"Over a month ago Maria complained about outlet wires had next to my computer area, Today complained that I still had too many electrical cords and pointed to different areas of my apartment which she had not previously complained about. I told her I would remove these cords, and she also said that my apartment was unsanitary, but when I asked her to show me what was unsanitary she did not show me anything.   Also, I pointed out to her that over the 5 years I have been living here at 4949 South Cottage Grove (The Mauldelle Brown Bousfield Apartments} not one of the annual inspections done by the CHA had mentioned anything about the electrical cords or my apartment being unsanitary, and when the Property Manager Brenda Cochran had came by twice over a month ago she did not say anything about too many electrical cords or sanitation in my apartment.  She (according to what Brenda Cochran had told me over the phone earlier today was suppose to have bought a maintenance worker with her to pull my Air Conditioner out just enough so I could write the serial number down  so I could get back n touch with that company that distributed it and have a technician come by and check it. If that technician could not fix it the company would replace it in about one day, no charge. However, Maria did not bring any maintenance worker with her and refused to send one up to examine or pull the A/C out some from the wall so I could get the serial number off of it. As it is the serial number is concealed, so I can not write it down.  Since Maria is not really qualified to determine what constitutes too many electrical cords and obviously does not know about proper sanitation in an apartment I feel she should come and get the lease violation notice she issued to me immediately.
