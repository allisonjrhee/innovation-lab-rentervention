6908,Essential Services,My renter breached the contract 
7047,Essential Services,"I have been threatened for years by my building manager and owners. I've been threatened with being kicked out if I ""bother"" anyone with my repair/upkeep needs in my unit. The real estate office and owner have not been open in some time. Yesterday I saw a sign up saying that Hillcrest was up for sale. The water is not working, there's no running water in bathroom. I found a massive part of my closet wall infected with black mold , water stains and other weird mold!! I am disabled and limited income and can't find a safe place to move. I have witnessed drug deals in my building (which management is AWARE OF , along with the gang activity here. They don't keep building safe. There's mold, water damage, and MICE all over the building) I have been sexually harassed by the old bldg manager for many years. My mailbox and use of my address by strangers without my consent have occurred. I'm now having identity issues on top of all else. The post office is aware of the problem with the mail here but can't get the owner to replace the mailboxes. I have been threatened by the gang members &the drug dealers, they have also threatened the life of my cat. The situation here is dire. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I'm afraid of being homeless but this place isn't ok. I have been too scared to leave home for almost 2years now and it's getting worse here. I cannot leave my apartment unless I can take my cat with me, as I don't feel she's safe here alone after the threats. The floor I live on has become mostly empty EXCEPT for the gang members. I saw a neighbor who's a known crack dealer - on a stool in the hallway stashing something up above a storage closet door/up by the pipes near ceiling and another time putting something inside the hallway emergency lights. Ever since then, the apartment next to me seems to have a group of of early 20s? Kids that shout threats through the shared closet wall. I don't feel safe even inside my home. Also my front door has been broken into numerous times, but I didn't see anything missing and wasn't sure if it would be believed or worth reporting. But it's ruining my life. I saw the Hillcrest Realty company had a for sale sign on it and the office is never open anymore. Most of the businesses under the building are closed for no reason. Having a lot of health issues and severe anxiety over this. I'm also disabled. I was told my initial receipt for moving in here over 5yrs ago WAS my lease. So I do not have a lease document. This has happened to previous tenants as well. I'm afraid I'll get kicked out before I can find an affordable place to move to if I ask for repairs. They always blame tenants and threaten.  I can't bathe there's no water in bathroom and kitchen sink started leaking. There are MICE all in building &I can hear them in the walls and ceiling of my bathroom. The whole place is disgusting and they don't put up proper notices. I was gone from mid October to beginning of January, for reasons I'd like to speak to a LAWYER about because I'm so scared of what happened /who advised me to leave my home for ""awhile, a few days at LEAST for your safety ma'am!"" There's so much I don't know where to start but need immediate assistance "
