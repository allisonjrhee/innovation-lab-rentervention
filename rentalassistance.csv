I have developed debilitating rheumatoid arthritis and have been struggling to walk and consequently pay my rent for the past 8 months (although I have always still paid on time and in full). After breaking down my body and getting fired from multiple jobs for my condition, I have finally found a part-time job that I can do. However, it doesn’t pay enough for me to make rent. I found a cheaper place to move into May first that I can actually afford, but my roommate who I am currently subleasing from refuses to relieve me from my agreement and take on one of the viable, female subleasers I have found to replace me. As such, I am now stuck paying two leases when the original problem was that I don’t have enough money to even pay one. Do I qualify for rental assistance? Please help"
