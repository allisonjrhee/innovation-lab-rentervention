197,No Match,"To whom it may concern,       Over the last few weeks I have been in contact with WGEM, the Safe and Livable Housing Committee, contacted the Quincy Herald Whig and went to the city council meeting on August 15th over concerns of corruption in the city with a local land lord. I went before city council to address concerns about the City of Quincy giving landlords heads up messages when tenants file they're complaints. Immediately after I filed my complaint with the City they sent him a message to meet up with him before meeting up with me. He then forwarded that message to me seemingly mocking me for filing suggesting the city is on his side even if someone files a complaint. After I went to city counsel an investigation was started but this particular landlord has a brother who's a lawyer with one of the largest law firms in Quincy. He continues to get away with taking advantage of good people because our city also makes money off his property taxes. I was fortunate enough to get my money back but still have an unpaid water bill. I went before City with a 14 pg. packet I handed to all the alderman, the mayor, and all the news outlets that was present that evening. At the end of the meeting Mike Farha motioned for an investigation. Our city doesn't want this getting out because it shows how negligent our local government treats working class people and favors landlords in landlord tenant issues. It seems completely unethical to give landlords a heads up and then seemingly harass and slander it's citizens when they do file calling them names like a ""Whiner"". If you follow the timeline in the attached files and screenshots of messages and transactions, I was told I would be contacted by the city before the landlord. That didn't happen and the city of Quincy's planning and development messaged him first that Tuesday morning at 11:54 in the morning directly after I filed my complaint. I have filed Complaints with the following agencies. The National Safety Council, The Office of The Attorney General, The State of Illinois Ethics Commission, The Federal Transit Administration Civil Rights Division, The Better Business Bureau and The U.S. Department of Justice, and The Department of Housing and Urban Development. Part of the problem bis the City of Quincy is helping him, I filed my complaint against Chris Bickhaus and his property owned by International Properties inc. When the City filed it's Notice of violations on his property they filed it for Phoenix International Properties Inc??? When I went before City council the meeting wasn't aired that night??

My friend is a vet who has struggled with addiction, and the building has a zero tolerance policy. As such, I was notified that I could risk eviction. I spoke with my friend about it, and while upset, he understood the situation and left. I'm hoping that settles the issue, but I'm worried that the building manager may follow-up today."

Because we rent with Mac properties at our new apartment and im on both leases still for some reason, they told us we can only pay with a money order because of multiple late payments (this was from my old roommate at the apartment I haven't lived in for 4 months. I called Mac and explained the situation they assured me I would be removed from the old lease by Tuesday. It's now Wednesday and I'm still on the old lease.

2054,No Match,"Can I deduct uncompensated services from rent? On March 20th of this year a water main ruptured 3 feet from my unit, destroying the basement, rendering the unit uninhabitable. I returned on May 15th even though I had paid at another location until July 1st, due to the fact that the date for move in changed multiple times in the  2 months we were out of the unit. Part of my lease includes that I maintain lawn from April through October and snow November through March, in exchange for the basement connecting to my unit. As per my lease I mowed the lawn April and May and once in June. The owners of the unit promised that the wall in the basement would be restored so I could have security to the area I am renting. It never happened. They recently sent me an email requesting I perform certain actions, and terminating the rider pertaining to use of the basement, on the grounds that I have been deficient in my duties. I replied with an email asking for a meeting on the matter. I detailed that I would comply with all their demands with the exception of moving their property which I didn't remove. I detailed why I haven been deficient, if anything, they did not make all efforts to deliver their end of the contract. That I performed my contracted obligation without compensation. I also made it clear in writing what my wife has communicated verbally, that at least one of the owners has a personal problem with us.  2 minutes after I sent the email that owner called me telling me my wife was lying to me about their interaction. I felt, and told him he was being aggressive and ignoring the point of the email which was to address some concerns I have and request a meeting. The next day I was informed that they would not be allowing me to stay after my lease expires at the end of August. To compensate for the short notice they will allow me to stay 1 extra month. If you look at the history of communication between us I have been nothing but compliant, and helpful. I believe this is retaliation for asking for the meeting. I believe this and the messages sent in which they lied to intimidate us, by claiming that if the local municipal police arrest me ( for what reason I don't know) then that the municipal police will evict me on the spot in addition to other things, such as taking 2 months to repair a leak in to my bedroom from the bathroom of the above unit, is evidence of unacceptable treatment. So now I don't trust them to treat me fair, and I am afraid they will try to take my entire security deposit and not compensate me for the unpaid lawn services. I am currently unemployed and broke. Is there any way I can protect myself?"

I haven't had a lease in two years and Hud's tenant's rights says that accurate account of my income should be documented so that I'm charged the right amount for rent (which is between base and market rent). The recertification person refuses to check my income and the landlord/recertification specialist is trying to force me to sign a lease for market rent and i haven't had a lease in two years. I was served a determination of tendacy in March due to no rent being paid while waiting to meet the specialist since December of 2021. I changed from Section 8 to section 236 due to the landlord explaining that section 8 only helped women with children once their job status changed. If I moved to section 236 my rent would not go above market rent even when I made more. My current wages are less before I signed to section 236 (which was before the pandemic). I have been unemployed multiple times and have kept my market rent paid until recently. What actions should I take next?

However, the building property management that manages my building charged me $2600 for not letting them know sooner that I am moving out, keeping in mind I only have a one-year lease with them that finishes June 30th. I have let them know I am not paying any fees that aren't related to rent and they threatening to report the fee to the credit bureau.   My concern now is, that I am trying to prevent that from happening and if it did I will like to sue them for damaging my credit. With that said, I am seeking legal advice and help. So, I was wondering If anyone can help me with this. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you."

We were told on 5/25 that the offer of the additional storage is no longer available. On 5/27, we requested to break the lease, as the storage is important to us and it is in our lease that we can have it. They agreed to break the lease and return our deposit, but not our first months rent. Since it's in our lease that the storage is ours and they then rescinded it, are they obligated to return our first months rent?"

4659,No Match,"Hi there, Metropolitan Tenant's rights suggested I submit a police report, but the police will not listen to our case. Our rights are being violated under a city ordinance that lies in police jurisdiction: Municipal Code 5-12-160  Prohibition on interruption of tenant occupancy by landlord.   ""It is unlawful for any landlord or any person acting at his direction knowingly to oust or dispossess or threaten or attempt to oust or dispossess any tenant from a dwelling unit without authority of law, by any act rendering a dwelling unit or any part thereof or any personal property located therein inaccessible or uninhabitable."" Whenever a complaint of violation of this provision is received by the Chicago Police Department, the department shall investigate and determine whether a violation has occurred. Any person found guilty of violating this section shall be fined not less then $200.00 nor more than $500.00, and each day that such violation shall occur or continue shall constitute a separate and distinct offense for which a fine as herein provided shall be imposed.   https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2639281 The police claim this is not a police matter, but the ordinance is clear that it is, what can we do? We are experiencing an illegal interruption of tenancy/constructive eviction and were instructed to file a police report by Tenant's Rights. We have been in our unit for 4 years. The landlord, Thomas Weaver of Riverside Property Management, regularly engages in illegal gut rehab demolition/renovation without permits. On 4/20/22, he began renovating the unit below us, ripping out walls and ceiling without a permit. We and other surrounding neighbors requested he use mitigating techniques during construction (box fans, air scrubbers, shop vacs, etc). to minimize the health hazards and effects on the surrounding units (the last demo he did in Nov/December severely impacted our and other units, and many tenants contacted Riverside reporting the issues, reporting illness, being forced to stay in hotels, etc.). We had to evacuate on 4/20/22 due to the large amount of plaster dust entering our unit. On 4/27/22, the city caught him and shut down the construction until permits are obtained, but our unit was coated in plaster/drywall dust; every surface, inside cabinets and closets, etc. We contacted a landlord/tenant mediator who asked Riverside to use mitigation techniques once work resumes, Riverside refused and expressed his preference that we ""just move out."" Tenant Rights referred us to you, as it is clear he is attempting a constructive eviction of myself and my partner. Riverside has not responded to any of our emails detailing the effects on our unit and our health, and the fact that we had to evacuate. We returned to our unit and conducted extensive cleaning over several days, but since the ceiling below us (our floor) is left open and exposed in the unit below, we are still having effects in our unit and are experiencing respiratory symptoms. We believe Riverside’s actions during this construction, specifically intentionally avoiding safe demolition practices to protect the health and habitability of the surrounding units are purposeful, retaliatory, and an attempt at interruption of tenancy and impose a constructive eviction (municipal code 5-12-160). Our unit was made thoroughly unfit, Thomas Weaver expressed his desire that the complaining tenants move out, and our unit is still not safe for our occupancy."

My grandfather brought the house for my parents in 1992 and he died 2015. I don't know if her or my great grandfather left a will because my aunt got rid of everything in grandmothers house and sold it before we could see anything.  There is a transfer on death instrument document that says it was filled by my great grandmother Willa Murdock who was 100 and unable to sit let alone file any papers. About 2 weeks ago my aunt her daughter called my mom to tell her someone was coming to check the water meter and on 4/3 our water was turned off, after we were specifically told by the man who read the meter it could not be turned off. On the 4/5 we received a letter stating that the house would be condemned in 6 days due to no water in the house. I live with my parents, (my father is disabled) who have custody of my sisters 5 children (one of whom is also disabled) and my son. I was able to get the water turned back on for a time.

Her neighbor made her aware January 30th that a note was on her door.  I have been requesting that the time on this notice be restored since proper notice was not given, they have refused and threatened to start eviction proceeding April 1st.

7500,No Match,"a friend of mine, she is a child care provider, does not speak or write English well. She is in need of a lawyer. I only know general details. Last year, she bought a building that has a child care center, the owner sold her everything, the building, the center with the furniture, everything. The owner has refused to leave the premises, she kept on taking control of the business arguing that my friend did not yet have her licence, and that she will leave or surrender the business when my friend gets her DCFS license. This issue about the licence is not of her business, when she sold the building including the center, she was supposed to leave immediately. She has been taking all of the money and copayments from parents, but we think she has been able to do this because her  DCFS Rep. has been involved. Now my friend has her own DCFS licence, but the lady (owner) refuses to sign and leaves. My friend has been receiving threats since last year, threatening her to call the police and immigration. Any information about what she can do or where she can call it will be highly appreciated."
