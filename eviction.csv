7315,Eviction,I received a 5 day notice. I have been having issues at the property for over 6 months. I sent a 14 day notice regarding rodent issues and began to with hold 30 % of the rent after the issues were not addressed or resolved. The management company refused to accept the adjusted rent amount and added late fees every month. I fell behind on the rent because of this and because of Childcare issues related to covid. Management company refuses to make the adjustment on the amount due to reflect the updated value of the apartment . I applied for emergency rental assistance and am currently going through the process. It is not fair for the 5 day notice to list an inaccurate amount due. What can I do? There are safety issues and exposure to drug use that threatens the health of my familty

7652,Eviction,"My landlord is trying to evict my children and I for non-payment, but I tried paying him back in October and he refused to accept it. He stated he just wanted us out by November but my teenage son had open heart surgery and the landlord and his mother tried in so many ways to press charges based on lies. Since they called DCFS on me, DCFS closed the case because nothing was found, they tried pressing charges on false accusations on my son who had surgery and the detective also closed the case because nothing was found, now they are filing an order of protection and requested that judge evict me and that was denied because the judge stated he had nothing to do with that. Then I received a letter from the landlord with a notice of eviction 45 days, then I received a letter from their lawyer stating the same thing and now they have open a court case. Due to the fact that they had made it impossible for me to continue with my second job I find myself not being able to find a place to relocate so quick with my 3 children. My court is on March 9th at 9am I need someone to help me with this case. "
